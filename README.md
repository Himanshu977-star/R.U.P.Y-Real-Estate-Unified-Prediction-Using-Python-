This project aims to develop a digital platform where farmers can input crop data, access real-time market trends, and receive weather-based recommendations. By leveraging data analytics, predictive modeling, and weather integration, the platform will help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection and planting.
The platform will also provide insights into collective crop trends, preventing oversupply and ensuring fair compensation for farmers. With features like centralized data analysis, market demand forecasting, and weather suitability checks, this project promotes sustainable agriculture while stabilizing the food industry.
Through this initiative, we aim to empower farmers with actionable insights, improve agricultural productivity, and balance food supply and demand.
