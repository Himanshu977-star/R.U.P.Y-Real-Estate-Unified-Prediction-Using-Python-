# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Real Estate Price Prediction** system that uses **Machine Learning** to estimate home prices based on user inputs. It includes a **trained Linear Regression model**, a **Flask API**, and a **web-based frontend** for user interaction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and outlier removal  
- Machine learning model using **Scikit-learn**  
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV** and **K-Fold Cross Validation**  
- Flask API for serving real-time price predictions  
- Web-based frontend using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- **Flask** (for API development)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for frontend)  
- **Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm** (for development)  

## Usage
1. Enter property details (**square feet, number of bedrooms, etc.**).  
2. Click the **Predict** button to fetch results from the **Flask API**.  
3. View the **estimated price instantly**.  

## Future Enhancements
- Support for **advanced ML models** (**Random Forest, XGBoost**).  
- **Cloud deployment** for scalability.  
- **Dynamic dataset updates** for real-time predictions.
